								Mini Project : Postfix Calcualator (Evaluator)
								
								
		Our project is based on calculating the value of postfix expression, where we have included scientific
		operations like tan , cos , sin , exponential and so on . The operations we have included has been displayed
		in the program . The precidence for each operators has also been displayed in the program. Where scientific 
		operators has been given more precidence than the usual operators.
		
		If we have to find the value of 2*3+sin(45)
		we have to enter the post fix expression : 23s+
		Then the prompt will ask for value of sin in degree(where the conversion has been made in back end of the code)
		Then it displays the answer.
		
		This can also work like calculator and expression evaluation .
		
		Thanks.
